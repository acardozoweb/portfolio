                Hi there! 
                My name is Anthony and I was born & raised in Ottawa, Ontario. 
                I'm new to web development and created this page as assignment in a full-stack web dev boot camp.
                My background is in event coordination and promotion, mostly involving live music.
                I have played in bands and booked events since I was a teenager, and more recently
                I ran an independent music festival and opened a small venue with a few friends. 
                I'm excited to see where web development will take me!
                Thanks for checking out my portfolio page!
            </p>
